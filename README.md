# Arduino-Blynk-Joystick-4-Motor-Robot-Rover
The code below was developed to operate a four motor Rover-Robot with an Arduino 101 and 
 Adafruit Motor-Servo Controller Shield using the Blynk iPhone app using the Blynk "Joystick" and Blynk
 "Long Slider" over a BLE Bluetooth connection. This code should work for a 2 motor Rover. You will have to 
 designate the motors appropriately in the Define Motor Port Section ~line 43. 

 Note: This code generates an error "Blynk.begin(auth, blePeripheral);"
                                                                    ^
 during compliation. It doesn't seem to be an issue.
 
 Use this code at your own risk!
